## Proposed Sequence

Recommended order considering dependencies and effort:

### Phase 1: Critical & Quick Wins ✅ COMPLETE

| Order | Item | Type | Rationale |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | [#100](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/100) Password reset bug | Bug | ✅ Resolved 2025-12-07 |
| 2 | [#107](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/107) Song naming for files | Issue | ✅ Implemented 2025-12-07 |

### Phase 2: Practice Tracking ✅ COMPLETE

| Order | Item | Type | Rationale |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| 3 | [#125](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/125) Practice logging | Issue | ✅ Closed (PR #135) |
| 4 | [#126](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/126) Filtering & sorting | Issue | ✅ Closed (PR #135) |
| 5 | [#121](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/121) Virtualize table | Issue | Ready - deps complete |

### Phase 3: Band Management (In Progress)

| Order | Item | Type | Rationale |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| 6 | [#127](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/127) Band selector | Issue | ✅ Closed (PR #139) |
| 7 | [#128](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/128) Band settings | Issue | Completes band management |
| 8 | Close [#124](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/124) | Issue | Parent tracking issue done |

### Phase 4: Larger Efforts

| Order | Item | Type | Rationale |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| 9 | [feat-user-member-linking-phase-3](pending/feat-user-member-linking-phase-3.md) | Spec | Large feature, personalization |
| 10 | [#101](https://github.com/zazu-22/band_assist/issues/101) Mobile iOS refactor | Issue | Large scope, device testing needed |

### Parallel Opportunities

These can run concurrently with minimal conflict:

- **#128** (band settings) — ready to start, #127 complete
- **#101** (mobile) can run in parallel with Phase 3/4 if resources allow
