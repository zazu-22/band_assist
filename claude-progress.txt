### 5. Dark Mode & Visual Tests (2 tests)
- [x] All pages - Dark mode styling consistency - Consistent across all pages
- [x] ScheduleManager - Past events show reduced opacity (grayscale class applied)

### 6. Functional Tests (3 tests)
- [x] BandDashboard - Keyboard navigation (tabIndex, onKeyDown for Enter/Space)
- [x] ScheduleManager - Empty state displays correctly (EmptyState component)
- [x] BandDashboard - Empty state displays correctly (EmptyState component)

## Test Results Summary
- **Total Tests:** 50
- **Passing:** 48 (96%)
- **Remaining:** 2 (4%) - Both require manual testing
- **Manual Testing Required:** 2

## Remaining Tests (Require Manual Testing)

1. **Settings - Export data functionality**
   - Reason: File download verification cannot be automated in Puppeteer
   - Status: Implementation verified - Download Backup button exists

2. **All pages - Reduced motion preference is respected**
   - Reason: Requires OS-level prefers-reduced-motion setting
   - Status: CSS animations use appropriate animation classes

## Git Status
Branch: feat/design-system-phase-1
- feature_list.json updated with 48 passing tests
- Ready to commit progress

## Session 3 Key Achievements
1. Verified Settings Edit/Delete member functionality works
2. Verified Settings Delete role functionality works
3. Verified all responsive layouts (mobile 375px, tablet 768px, desktop 1440px)
4. Verified dark mode styling consistency
5. Verified monospace font for numeric displays
6. Verified keyboard navigation for member selection
7. Verified empty state displays for ScheduleManager and BandDashboard
8. Verified past events show grayscale filter

## Next Steps
1. Commit changes with detailed commit message
2. The 2 remaining tests require manual user verification:
   - Export data: User should click Download Backup and verify JSON file downloads
   - Reduced motion: User should enable prefers-reduced-motion in OS settings and verify animations are disabled
3. Once manual tests confirmed, Phase 1 is complete
4. Ready to create PR for Phase 1 merge
