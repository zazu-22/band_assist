# Claude Code Progress Summary - Session 1 (Initializer Agent)

## Date: 2024-11-28

## Overview
This session focused on setting up the foundation for the SongDetail subpage design system extension project. The existing codebase already had SetlistManager components aligned with the design system (50 features, all passing). This session extended the feature tracking to include SongDetail subpage work.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Extended feature_list.json
- Added 101 new features specifically for SongDetail subpages
- Combined with existing 50 SetlistManager features (all passing)
- Total: 151 features tracked
- All new SongDetail features start with `"passes": false`

### 2. Updated init.sh
- Added guidance for SongDetail design extension workflow
- Listed key files to modify:
  - src/components/SongDetail.tsx (main refactor target)
  - src/components/ui/MetadataItem.tsx (new component to create)
  - src/components/ui/UploadZone.tsx (new component to create)
  - docs/design-system.md (add new pattern sections)
- Added feature tracking instructions

### 3. Project Analysis Complete
- Reviewed existing SongDetail.tsx (1020 lines, uses legacy zinc-* classes)
- Reviewed design-system.md for established patterns
- Reviewed SetlistManager components as exemplary implementations
- Understood the gap between current SongDetail and design system

   - Phase 4: Chart Management
   - Phase 5: Animations
   - Phase 6: Audio Features

3. Create new components:

## Files Modified This Session
- feature_list.json (extended with 101 new features)
- init.sh (updated guidance for SongDetail work)
- claude-progress.txt (this file)

## Environment Status
- Git branch: feat/setlist-subpage-design-extension
- Node version: 22.18.0
- Project type: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4

## Critical Reminder for Future Agents
**NEVER remove or edit features in feature_list.json**
Features can ONLY be marked as passing (change `"passes": false` to `"passes": true`).
This ensures no functionality is missed across sessions.
