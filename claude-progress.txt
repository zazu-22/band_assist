## Session 1 - Nov 28, 2024 (Initial Setup)

### Overview
This session focused on setting up the foundation for the SongDetail subpage design system extension project. The existing codebase already had SetlistManager components aligned with the design system (50 features, all passing). This session extended the feature tracking to include SongDetail subpage work.

### Completed Tasks
1. Created Extended feature_list.json (101 new features for SongDetail)
2. Updated init.sh with guidance
3. Project analysis complete

### Git Commit
- fb33dde - feat: extend feature_list.json with SongDetail subpage test cases

---

## Environment Status
- Git branch: feat/setlist-subpage-design-extension
- Node version: 22.18.0
- Project type: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4

## Critical Reminder for Future Agents
**NEVER remove or edit features in feature_list.json**
Features can ONLY be marked as passing (change `"passes": false` to `"passes": true`).
This ensures no functionality is missed across sessions.
