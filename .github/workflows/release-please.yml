# Release Please - Automated Versioning
#
# This workflow automates versioning and changelog generation using release-please.
#
# Flow:
# 1. On push to main, release-please analyzes commits since last release
# 2. If releasable changes found, creates/updates a "Release PR" with version bump
# 3. When Release PR is merged, release-please creates a GitHub Release (as draft)
# 4. The GitHub Release triggers release.yml workflow (on: release: [published])
#    to run builds and production deployment
#
# Manual releases are still possible via release.yml's workflow_dispatch
